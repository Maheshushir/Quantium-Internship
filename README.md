# Quantium-Internship

This project is part of the Quantium Internship program where we have analyzed transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies. Our work involved developing metrics and examining sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance. We have also created visualizations and prepared findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy.
